  <h1>About Solvin Cold Syrup 60 ml</h1>
  <p>Solvin Cold Syrup 60 ml belongs to the class of medication called 'cough and cold medications' primarily used to treat symptoms of the common cold and allergies like sneezing, runny/stuffy nose, fever, headache, body pains, congestion, or watery eyes. The common cold is a respiratory illness affecting the nose and throat. It is mostly caused by viruses known as 'rhinovirus'. The virus enters the body through the nose, mouth, or eyes and spreads easily through droplets in the air when the person who is sick sneezes, coughs, or talks.</p>
  
  <p>Solvin Cold Syrup 60 ml is a combination of three drugs, namely: Paracetamol (mild analgesic and antipyretic), Phenylephrine hydrochloride (decongestant), and Chlorpheniramine maleate (antihistamine/antiallergic). Paracetamol works by inhibiting the production of certain chemical messengers in the brain known as prostaglandins responsible for pain and fever. Phenylephrine hydrochloride works by shrinking the blood vessels in the nasal passage. Thereby providing relief from congestion and decreasing excess mucus production. Chlorpheniramine maleate works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance responsible for causing allergic reactions. It helps to provide relief from symptoms of allergy.</p>
